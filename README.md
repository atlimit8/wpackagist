WordPress Packagist
===

This is the repository for [wpackagist.org](https://wpackagist.org) which allows WordPress plugins and themes to be
managed along with other dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

More info and usage instructions at [wpackagist.org](https://wpackagist.org) or follow us on

## Usage

Example composer.json:

```json
{
    "name": "acme/brilliant-wordpress-site",
    "description": "My brilliant WordPress site",
    "repositories":[
        {
            "type":"composer",
            "url":"https://wpackagist.org",
            "only": ["wpackagist-plugin/*", "wpackagist-theme/*"]
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "aws/aws-sdk-php":"*",
        "wpackagist-plugin/akismet":"dev-trunk",
        "wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo":">=7.0.2",
        "wpackagist-theme/hueman":"*"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "Acme": "src/"
        }
    }
}
```

## WordPress core

This does not provide WordPress itself.

See https://github.com/fancyguy/webroot-installer or https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress.

## How it works

WPackagist implements the `wordpress-plugin` and `wordpress-theme` Composer Installers (https://github.com/composer/installers).

It essentially provides a lookup table from plugin name to WordPress.org SVN repository. Plugin versions correspond to different tags in their repository, with the special `dev-master` version being mapped to `trunk`.

The lookup table is provided as many static JSON files. The entry point to these files can be found at https://wpackagist.org/packages.json. Each plugin and theme has its own JSON file detailing its versions; these can be found in https://wpackagist.org/p/wpackagist-plugin/ and https://wpackagist.org/p/wpackagist-theme/.

## Running Wpackagist

### Installing

1. Make sure you have Composer dependencies installed, including extensions.
2. Make sure [`data`](data/) is writable. Do NOT create `data/packages.sqlite` manually; use the `migrate` command.
3. Run `composer install`.
4. Point your Web server to [`web`](web/). A [`.htaccess`](web/.htaccess) is provided for Apache.

### Updating the database

The first database fetch may easily take 30-60 minutes, be patient.

0. `bin/console migrate`: Ensure the database schema is up to date with the code.
1. `bin/console refresh`: Query the WordPress.org SVN in order to find new and updated packages.
2. `bin/console update`: Update the version information for packages identified in `1`. Uses the WordPress.org API.
3. `bin/console build`: Rebuild all `.json` files in `web/`.

## Running locally with Docker

This may be simpler than setting up native dependencies, but is
experimental.

To prepare environment variables:

    cp .env .env.local

and edit as necessary.

To set up and update the database:

    docker-compose run --rm cron composer install
    docker-compose run --rm cron

To start a web server on `localhost:30100`:

    docker-compose up -d web
